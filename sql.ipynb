      "Longest line: interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full scale conditions . for small scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two dimensional aerofoils and straight and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full scale conditions full scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter relation between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain unsteady flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of the paper .\n",
